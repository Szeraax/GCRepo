    "Closing Remarks",
    "By President Gordon B. Hinckley",
    "President of the Church",
    "What has been said by each of the speakers represents his or her prayerful attempt to impart knowledge that will inspire.",
    "My beloved brethren and sisters, we have enjoyed a wonderful conference. We have rededicated the Salt Lake Tabernacle, as we put it back to use after extensive renovation. We have filled this Conference Center to capacity for every session. Our words have gone across the world to members of the Church scattered far and wide.",
    "Now we will return to our homes. We urge you who will be driving to do so carefully. Let no accident destroy the spirit of this wonderful occasion.",
    "We hope that you will use the May edition of the Church magazines as a text for your family home evenings to review that which has been spoken in this conference. What has been said by each of the speakers represents his or her prayerful attempt to impart knowledge that will inspire and cause all who have heard it to stand a little taller and be a little better.",
    "May there be peace and harmony in your homes. Husbands, love and treasure your wives. They are your most precious possessions. Wives, encourage and pray for your husbands. They need all the help they can get. Parents, treat your children with great kindness. They are the coming generation who will bring honor to your name.",
    "Now, as we separate for a season, God bless you, my beloved associates. I so pray, as I say good-bye, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."
