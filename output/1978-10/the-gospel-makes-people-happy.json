    "The gospel of Jesus Christ, as we know it, and as it has been restored to the earth, makes people happy. I was speaking to a prominent lawyer from New York a short time ago. He looked at me in my circumstances and said, “What more could you ever want in life?” I agreed with him, and I analyzed it: I looked into my past, into my present, and of course, realized once again the great blessings we enjoy as a family unit. I love my wife. The Lord gave her to me. I love the gospel. I know it’s true.

He is the representative of the Lord on this earth. I know this is true.",
    "Because the gospel of Jesus Christ makes us happy, we do desire to share this message with all people. I pledge my life and means and full service to the Lord, to the presidency of the Church, and to any persons who preside over me. I desire to serve. I have said on many occasions recently that one of the things I would dislike the most is not to be involved. It didn’t matter what I was doing, just so I was doing something in the Church.",
    "The Savior’s example of service was great to us. We should follow and emulate the same.",
    "I pray for a special blessing to be with each of us, that we may catch the vision that President Kimball has as to the great need and urgency that is in the world to expedite the work. I pray that we may be able to do so, of course, with only one thing in mind, and that is to further and strengthen the work.",
    "My wife and I had a very unique experience this last week or two. Something we had planned on doing for nearly twenty years was coming to fruition at the end of this year. We independently looked at each other and said, “I don’t know why, but I don’t think we should do it.” And of course, Thursday we found out why.",
    "I’m grateful for the intervention of the Lord in my life. I pray that I will be worthy of the great many blessings he gives to me, that I might be a great service to the upbuilding of his kingdom, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen."
