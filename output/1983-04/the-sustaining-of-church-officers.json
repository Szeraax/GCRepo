    "With the exception of these brethren we have just sustained, and noting the passing of our dear friend and brother, Elder LeGrand Richards of the Quorum of the Twelve, there have been no changes in the General Authorities since the last conference. It is proposed, therefore, that we sustain all of the General Authorities and general officers of the Church as at present constituted.",
