    "My brothers and sisters, as requested by President Benson, I shall now present to you the General Authorities and general officers of the Church for your sustaining vote.",
    "It is proposed that we sustain President Ezra Taft Benson as prophet, seer, and revelator and President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints; Gordon B. Hinckley as First Counselor in the First Presidency; and Thomas S. Monson as Second Counselor in the First Presidency. Those in favor may manifest it. Any opposed may manifest it.",

Tom Perry, David B. Haight, James E. Faust, Neal A. Maxwell, Russell M. Nelson, Dallin H. Oaks, M. Russell Ballard, and Joseph B. Wirthlin. Those in favor, please manifest it.

    "As announced a few months ago, Carlos E. Asay has been released as a President of the First Quorum of the Seventy in order to serve as President of the Europe Area. In view of the action just taken, we also release Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin, who has been serving as a President of the First Quorum of the Seventy since August. Those who wish to extend a vote of appreciation to these Brethren for their faithful service may do so by the uplifted hand.",
    "We sustain as the Presidency of the First Quorum of the Seventy: Dean L. Larsen, Richard G. Scott, Marion D. Hanks, Wm. Grant Bangerter, Jack H. Goaslind, Robert L. Backman, and Hugh W. Pinnock. All in favor, please signify. Any opposed may so signify.",
    "We note with sadness the passing of Elders James A. Cullimore and O. Leslie Stone of the First Quorum of the Seventy. Parenthetically, I would like to say that we note with sadness the passing only yesterday of President Franklin McKean of the Brazil Recife Mission.",
    "With the exceptions which I have noted, there have been no changes in the General Authorities or the general officers of the Church since the last conference. It is proposed, therefore, that we sustain all of the General Authorities and general officers of the Church as at present constituted. All in favor, please manifest it. Any opposed by the same sign.",
    "It appears that the voting has been unanimous in favor of the General Authorities and general officers of the Church.",
    "Thank you, brothers and sisters, for your generous and prayerful support."
