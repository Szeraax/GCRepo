    "Sustaining of Church Officers",
    "President Spencer W. Kimball:",
    "Before we present the General Authorities and General Officers for the sustaining vote of this conference, we have a matter of business we should like to take up with you.",
    "We have extended to Sister Belle S. Spafford an honorable release as president of the Relief Society, and to her counselors, Marianne C. Sharp and Louise W. Madsen, and also to the entire general board an honorable release. We find it most difficult to find the words to express to these sisters our admiration for them and our gratitude to them. Their work has been a service of quality and devotion and sacrifice.",
    "Sister Spafford has been a strong and vibrant voice in many lands and many countries and among many peoples. Her voice has been heard in many places where it required insight and courage and forthrightness to stand almost alone against sometimes strange ideologies. She is a woman of education and refinement and a leader in thought and action. She has considerable secular and spiritual training. She has honorary degrees from two great universities. She has been active in women’s organizations, national and international, and has traveled abroad in her special work. Her late husband, Willis Earl Spafford, and her children sustained her in her monumental labors. She has traveled widely, written much, and spoken to numerous groups of people in many lands. I must mention her outstanding work in the Indian program where I came to note her stature. She is distinguished, honored, and loved.",
    "Sister Sharp is the daughter of our beloved late President J. Reuben Clark, Jr. She was the wife of the late Ivor Sharp. He and their family members supported her in her outstanding work. Her travels have been worldwide. Her wisdom and encouragement have been given to many peoples in many lands. She received an honorary degree of doctor of humanities from Brigham Young University recently. She has been an editor, writer, speaker, and an inspired leader.",
    "Sister Louise Wallace Madsen, married to Francis A. Madsen, is an exemplary wife and mother of a large family. Her work among the Indian children has brought many blessings to our Lamanite brothers and sisters. Sister Madsen is the granddaughter of Parley P. Pratt.",
    "And our gratitude, deep gratitude, also goes to all those, including the general board members, who have now been released. All of you who would like to express your thanks for the excellent service they have rendered, would you raise your right hand. Thank you very much.",
    "For many years Sister LaVern W. Parmley, president of the Primary Association, with her counselors, Naomi W. Randall and Florence R. Lane, and members of the general board of the Primary have rendered able and dedicated service in their respective callings. These lovely sisters have helped develop and administer programs around the world, designed to build testimony and character in the lives of the children of the Church. The labors of these sisters will bear fruit long into the future through the lives and deeds of the children whom they have influenced. With her counselors and general board, Sister Parmley has been an administering angel to the little ones of the Church.",
    "In line with the general practice of the Church of changing leadership from time to time, we therefore tender to Sister Parmley and to Sisters Randall and Lane and to all the members of the general board of the Primary an honorable release at this time, together with our sincere love and best wishes for the great service that they will doubtless render to the Church in the years to come. Will all those who would like to join with us in extending thanks to Sister Parmley and her associates please raise their hands. Thank you.",
    "Their successors will be presented to you for your vote by President Nathan Eldon Tanner who will now present all of the General Authorities and General Officers of the Church.",
