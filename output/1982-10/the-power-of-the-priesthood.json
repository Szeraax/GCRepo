    "The Power of the Priesthood",
    "By President Marion G. Romney",
    "Second Counselor in the First Presidency",
    "I have enjoyed being here with you in this meeting and have enjoyed the talks that have been given. I feel that the Spirit of the Lord has been with us.",
    "It’s a great thing to hold the priesthood of God, and that is what this is tonight—a priesthood meeting. The priesthood of God is power. It’s an endowment, which the Lord has given to us who hold the priesthood, to perform sacred ordinances that have effect in this world and in the world to come. It’s the greatest power in the world—the priesthood—and I am very happy that I have had the privilege through the years to bear the priesthood and to receive offices in the priesthood from deacon up to the offices of the Melchizedek Priesthood which I have had assignments to work in. I know that it’s the priesthood that will save this world. It is not a man-made organization; it is not a man-prepared organization—it embodies a power revealed from heaven and sent here to us to help us prepare our lives for eternal life in the presence of our Father in Heaven.",
    "It’s a great thing to see this building completely filled with bearers of the priesthood, both men who bear the Melchizedek Priesthood—old men like myself—and young men who bear the Aaronic Priesthood. I hope that we appreciate the authority that the Lord has given us to act in his service in the respective offices in the priesthood that we hold.",
    "I have held the priesthood for three-quarters of a century, from the time I was a deacon until I now hold the Melchizedek Priesthood, and I have enjoyed it all through the years. It has been sacred to me, and it is sacred to me now. I hope that you have the same feeling about the priesthood. Don’t ever do anything that you would be ashamed of, that you would be ashamed to talk to the Lord about, because we will meet him someday if we live the gospel well enough to have that privilege. We will be very grateful then, if we know, as he will know, that our lives have been in harmony with the teachings of the gospel and the responsibility that is placed upon us who hold the priesthood.",
    "I have enjoyed this meeting. I am glad I came, and I am glad I have heard what I have heard here tonight. I pray the Lord will bless each boy and man, old and young, that is here tonight with the feeling and determination that he will live the teachings of the gospel and magnify the priesthood which the Lord has given him. It will be a great day for us individually, when we’re called to give an account of our deeds down here on the earth, if we can be assured that the Lord will approve our actions and we can go on to the eternities beyond this life to experience the growth that comes to men and boys who hold the priesthood, faithfully do their duties, and seek the Lord.",
    "As I said before I have enjoyed this meeting tonight and I’m happy that you’ve been here. I hope you’ll all come tomorrow to the conference.",
    "I leave my blessings with you and pray that you will be given an understanding that priesthood power is the power of God. Never do anything to disappoint yourselves or your loved ones or the Lord, or that would diminish your right to blessings that will come to you through obedience to the priesthood as long as you live. I leave my blessings with you and my testimony, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."
