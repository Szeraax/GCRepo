    "By Elder Hans B. Ringger",
    "Of the First Quorum of the Seventy",
    "Elder Packer taught us two days ago, that in the early years of the Church, the Saints would sometimes get a letter from “Box B.” A letter from Box B meant you were getting a calling without being interviewed first. Presidents of the Church called members on missions with no warning beforehand. I feel the same way today.",
    "It’s a long way from Switzerland to this stand in Salt Lake City. I had to cross many borders. I had to ask for a visa, for permission to enter this country. But I found out that wherever I had to cross a border or had to talk with people, the people were friendly. That’s exactly what I need in my assignment—friends. I have some sitting behind me. I have some sitting before me.",
    "I’m really happy to be here and to serve. I don’t know at the moment all the questions I will be asked or how I will find solutions for them. But I know that I will get an answer when I work on it and pray about it. If I do that, I know I will be blessed in all I do.",
    "I am very thankful for my priesthood leaders, my parents, my sisters, my brethren, my teachers in Sunday School—all who have given me the strength to fulfill the assignments I get in my life. Hopefully, I can serve so that our Lord will be pleased. I am very thankful to the First Presidency for this privilege—for calling me to be a General Authority. I leave you my testimony that I know that our Lord lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that Joseph Smith is a true prophet. This I say in the name of Jesus Christ, amen."
