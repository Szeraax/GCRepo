    "Closing Remarks",
    "By President Gordon B. Hinckley",
    "President of the Church",
    "We have been inspired and lifted to a higher appreciation of this wonderful gospel.",
    "My beloved brothers and sisters, we now conclude a great conference. We have been edified, uplifted. We have been inspired and lifted to a higher appreciation of this wonderful gospel. The music, the spoken word, and the prayers have all been magnificent.",
    "We now return to our homes. If we are driving, let us be careful. Let no tragedy mar the experience we have enjoyed.",
    "All of the proceedings of this conference will appear in a subsequent issue of the Ensign and Liahona. We encourage you again to read the talks in your family home evenings and discuss them together as families. They are the products of much prayer and meditation and are well worthy of careful consideration.",
    "Now the conference is adjourned for six months. We look forward to seeing you again next April. I’m 97, but I hope I’m going to make it. May the blessings of heaven attend you in the meantime is our humble and sincere prayer in the name of our Redeemer, even the Lord Jesus Christ, amen."
